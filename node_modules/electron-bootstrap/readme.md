# Electron bootstrap

## Description
This is a very minimalistic electron app bootstrap. Pre-configured for:

* Electron
* TypeScript
* Angular 2

## Developer info
**Kick start developer environment:**
```
git checkout git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/masterjguscius/electron-bootstrap.git
npm install
npm start
```
Basically put all your source code in **app-src** directory and npm will transpile everything to **app** directory. For faster development run ```npm run dev:watch``` and npm will watch for changes in **app-src**. When ready to deploy run ```npm run dist:build``` and you will get built versions in **build** directory.

**One more thing:** This bootstrap will automatically install & enable **Devtron** extension while in dev mode. So no more work needed in that regard.

**Version bumping & git update:**
```
npm run bump:patch
npm run bump:minor
npm run bump:major
```

**Various useful building commands:**
```
npm run dev:build
npm run dev:watch
npm run dev:clean
npm run dist:build
npm run dist:clean
```

## Final words from author
This was my mini project to check out **Electron**. Hopefully someone will find it useful in their own projects. I will not update it anymore.
